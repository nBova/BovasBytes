*Before I get into anything, this recipe is originally from Joshua Weissman. I've made a couple edits to his original recipe that I believe improve it a lot, but I highly recommend checking out his video on YouTube titled [The Ideal Chocolate Chip Cookie + A Cookie Hack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyuec0PPz68).*

*I would also like to add that all of my measurements for this recipe are weight based. I typically prefer to use weight because it's easier for me and is just more accurate. If there's demand I can always add in cups.*

## Ingredients:
# Dry Ingredients:
- 200 grams All Purpose Flour
- 4 grams Baking Soda
- 3 grams Kosher Salt

# Wet Ingredients:
- 85 grams Granulated Sugar
- 200 grams Brown Sugar (light or dark, I use dark)
- 1 1/4 sticks Unsalted Butter
- 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk
- 6 grams vanilla extract

# Mix- Ins:
- 6-7 ounces Dark Chocolate (60-70%, I prefer in bar form)
- Sea salt

## Process:
- *NOTE: I do not have a stand mixer but if you would like to use one instead of doing everything by hand, go for it!*
- In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and kosher salt
- In a large bowl, combine the granulated and brown sugar and whisk until mixed thouroughly
- Brown your butter over medium heat in a sauce pan. If you don't know how to brown butter, check out [America Test Kitchen's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KvqLCKLn2E)
- Once your butter has been browned, add it into the bowl with the granulated and brown sugars, whisk until combined
- Before doing the next step, I recommend letting the sugar/ butter mixture cool down for a couple of minutes. We'll be adding in the egg to that next and we don't want scrambled eggs in our cookie dough!
- After a couple of minutes, add in the whole egg. Whisk until combined, and then add in the extra egg yolk. Whisk until combined again
- Add in the vanilla extract to the wet ingedients, and give it one more whisk until combined.

- Next up is to add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, which we'll do in parts
- Grab a wooden spoon or something sturdy to mix with, the dough will begin to stiffen up very quick
- Pour about 1/3 of the dry mixture into the wet mixture and stir until combined. Repeat this with the next 1/3 of the dry mixture, and again with the last 1/3. It's going to get very difficult to mix near the end, get ready for a workout!
- Once your cookie dough is mixed and all of the dry and wet ingredients have been incorporated, set it to the side.
- Grab your bars of dark chocolate and give them a rough chop. The varying size and shapes of the chocolate will give the cookies a unique look!
- Mix the chocolate into the cookie dough until combined
- This is the hardest part but put the cookie dough into the fridge for 30 minutes, or up to overnight, to let it chill

## Baking:
- Once your dough has chilled, or you've run out of patience, it's time to bake!
- Scoop and shape your cookie dough into balls and place onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper
- The size of the cookies is really up to you, just make sure you leave enough room between them on the baking sheet, and make all of them an equal size. Some people like to use cookie scoops here
- Here's where I get a little iffy- my oven does not have temperature control, so I have to work with what I got. I placed a thermometer in my oven and figured out it runs at 375Â°F. When I bake these, I let them go in my oven for about 6 and a half minutes. I recommend checking your first batch often. Once the cookies turn a nice golden brown, they should be done
- After taking them out of the oven, immediately sprinkle the cookies with a small pinch of sea salt
- Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a couple of minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely once they've cooled enough to hold shape.
- Enjoy!

## Thoughts
These cookies are always a hit whenver I make them. I've made them for family, work parties, and most recently for my kickball team's last game until spring! I've been asked the recipe for these multiple times, so this little post should serve as a good guide to replicate them! I highly recommend trying this one out, it's honestly one of the best chocolate chip cookies I've had. And to be able to make these in my own kitchen whenever I want?? It's dangerous.

One additinal thing I would like to comment on is the changes I made to Joshua Weissman's original recipe. One thing that I believe is a huge oversight, is that Josh never browned his butter for his recipe. Browned butter is one of those things that can really elevate a recipe. It deepens and adds a nutty flavor to the cookie. That pairs so well with the dark chocolate and sprinkle of sea salt on top.

Another change that I made is with the amount of granulated sugar. The original recipe calls for 112 grams of granulated sugar, but I found that it makes the cookies almost too sweet. Some people in the comments of Josh's video had the same viewpoint. So I decided to do the recipe with 85 grams of granulated sugar, and I feel it's the perfect amount of sweetness. Feel free to play around with it!

And finally, Josh goes over a method of "dropping" the baking sheet onto the baking rack halfway through baking. The method is supposed to develop a chewier, more dense cookie through means of interrupting the rising process of the dough. I've tried it a couple of times, and I'd say it definitely does produce cookies with those results, but I'm honestly lazy and don't do it anymore. I'm often prepping more baking sheets of cookie dough to go into the oven while the current one bakes, so I don't really find time for the pan dropping method. But if you'd like to try it, I recommend giving it a shot!
